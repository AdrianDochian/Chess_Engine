"cd src"  
"make"  
After running the above commands, the engine will be prepared as a jar file.  
The current version supports basic commands, such as:
xboard, new, force, go, white, black, quit, resign, move  
When switching teams, the engine should be forced to make a move by using the  
"move now" command inside the xboard.  

# Setup XBoard

    > `sudo apt-get install xboard`  
    > Documentation:  
    > https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/engine-intf.html  

 - [x] Java <-> Xboard interaction (send & receive data)
 - [x] Basic commands (xboard, new, force, go, white, black, quit, resign, move)
 - [x] Minimax with alpha-beta pruning

### Notes:  
#### How to play against the Java engine:  
run "make" inside the src folder
run "make run" to play against the engine

#### Logger and debugging:
In order to output text, you should use the Logger class. To log a message, call  
`Logger.log("Your-message-here");`  
The message will be displayed inside the *xboard.debug* file, created by Xboard when  
the *-debug* parameter is set.
